      In February, Node.js released a security patch (CVE-2023-46809 - RSA_PKCS1_PADDING) in their latest version,
      causing a disruption in plugins. Currently, the only solution is to downgrade as there is no workaround available.
      This issue specifically affects camera livestream functionality; however, other functionalities remain unaffected.
      If livestreaming isn't a requirement, you can continue using the latest version of Node.js. Enabling this
      workaround will allow you to circumvent the blocking mechanism that prevents plugins from running and displaying
      error messages related to NodeJS.
